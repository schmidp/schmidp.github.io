        <p>Y Combinator teaches a class at Stanford on startups: <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com">http://startupclass.samaltman.com</a></p>

<p>These are my notes on <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec02/">Lecture 2</a>:</p>

<h1 id="ideas-products-teams-and-execution-part-ii">Ideas, Products, Teams and Execution Part II</h1>

<h2 id="qa-on-lecture-1">Q&amp;A on Lecture 1</h2>

<p><strong>How to identify markets that are growing quickly:</strong></p>

<p>Trust your instincts. Younger people/students have an advantage. Just watch what you and others are doing.</p>

<p><strong>How to deal with burnout as a founder:</strong></p>

<p>It sucks, but you just have to keep going. Address the things that are going wrong . . .</p>

<h2 id="lecture-2">Lecture 2</h2>

<h3 id="co-founders">Co-Founders</h3>

<p>The co-founder relationship is very, very important – one of the most important decisions. The track record for companies whose founders don’t know each other well is very bad.</p>

<p>A solo founder is better than a random co-founder.</p>

<p>A founder should be relentlessly resourceful. A founder’s role model should be James Bond (really!). You need someone who behaves like James Bond.</p>

<p>You want to have known your co-founders for years.</p>

<p>You want a tough, calm co-founder.</p>

<p>Two or three co-founders work well. Five are really bad.</p>

<p>When should co-founders decide on the equity split? Very soon after they start working together. It should be near equal.</p>

<p>You have to discuss what happens when a co-founder leaves. Shares should vest over four years. Anyone who leaves within the first year gets nothing.</p>

<p>Co-founders should be in the same location. Sam is very skeptical about remote teams in general.</p>

<h3 id="team">Team</h3>

<p>Try not to hire! Be proud to have as few employees as possible.</p>

<p>The most successful YC companies have no or very few employees. In the early days, the goal should be not to hire.</p>

<p>The cost of getting an early hire wrong is very high. It usually kills the company.</p>

<p>Write down a list of core values a hire should have. Most importantly, he should love the product. (Would you still want to work on our project if you got a medical diagnosis that you had only one year left to live?)</p>

<p>Have a very high bar. Get the best people.</p>

<p>It can easily take a year to recruit someone very good.</p>

<p>How much time should you spend on hiring? Either 0 or 25% of your time.</p>

<p>Mediocre engineers do not build great companies. Mediocre engineers infect the culture of a startup and destroy it.</p>

<p>The best people to hire are people you or your coworkers already know.</p>

<p>For most early hires in a startup experience does not help very much, but appetite does.</p>

<p>What to look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are they smart?</li>
  <li>Do they get things done?</li>
  <li>Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?</li>
</ul>

<p>Call references. Dig in. Is this person in the top 5%? Why don’t you try to hire this person again?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good communication skills</li>
  <li>Maniacally determined (they should also like risk)</li>
  <li>Pass the “animal test” (see <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html">Paul Graham</a> )</li>
  <li>You would feel comfortable reporting to them</li>
</ul>

<p>Care more about giving equity to employees than investors. Be generous with equity to early employees.</p>

<p><strong>After you hire someone, you have to retain them.</strong> They have to feel happy and valued.</p>

<p>Praise your team. Give your team credit for all the good that happens. You take responsibility for the bad things.</p>

<p>Fire fast. It’s better for the company, it’s better for the employee.</p>

<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>

<p>Whatever the founders do becomes the culture. The founders have to be execution machines.</p>

<p>Ideas themselves are not worth anything without someone executing them.</p>

<p>The CEO has five jobs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set the vision</li>
  <li>Raise money</li>
  <li>Evangelize the company</li>
  <li>Hire and manage</li>
  <li><strong>Make sure the entire company executes</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Execution: Can you figure out what to do? You get it done.</strong></p>

<h4 id="focus">Focus</h4>

<p><strong>Focus.</strong> Identify the most important two or three things and work on them. Ignore or delegate the others. If you don’t, you will never be great about getting stuff done.</p>

<p>Many startups/founders work really hard, but they work on the wrong things. If you work really hard on the wrong things, nobody will care.</p>

<p>Communicate the goals. This keeps the company focused and everyone works in the right direction. Communicate them over and over again.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on growth and momentum.</strong> Have metrics for this. If you don’t focus on these two things, you are probably doing it wrong.</p>

<h4 id="intensity">Intensity</h4>

<p>You have to outwork your competitors.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relentless operating rhythm (move fast and break things)</li>
  <li>Obsession with execution quality</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to move fast, but maintain high quality (of course it’s tricky)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bias towards action: you need to make decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best founders are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quick: they respond to email quickly . . .</li>
  <li>Present: they show up at meetings . . .</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Always keep momentum.</strong> Never take your foot off the gas peddle. A winning team keeps winning. A losing team gets demotivated and keeps losing.</p>

<p>Software startups: always keep growing.</p>

<p>Hardware startups: don’t miss shipping dates.</p>

<p>Getting the product right in the beginning is the best way to avoid losing momentum later.</p>

<p>If you have a demotivated team, you have to find small wins. “Sales fix everything.”</p>

<p>Don’t worry about competitors unless they beat you with a real, shipped product. Don’t give a shit about press releases.</p>

<p>Don’t spend more money than you have.</p>
